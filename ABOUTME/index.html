        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm 18 years old and currently a student. I have a passion for computer science and coding, which I discovered during a 5-6 month web development course I attended. I have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS and enjoy working on web development projects.
            Beyond coding, I'm an enthusiast of computer games, and I love to immerse myself in virtual worlds. In addition to my digital interests, I'm also quite active in sports. I enjoy playing football, basketball, and volleyball, and I regularly hit the gym to stay fit.
            I'm on a journey to continually improve my coding skills and expand my knowledge in the field of technology. Combining my love for computers and my interest in sports keeps me balanced and motivated in both my academic and personal life
